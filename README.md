# BattleshipGame

C++ program for Battlship, a famous board game. This game can be played on terminal by two players, and they choose and plan their ships and their locations, and can see their hits and misses after each turn, as well as their opponent's hits and misses.

The game is highly interactive, and very indulging!

Rules of the game:
Game Objective
The object of Battleship is to try and sink all the other player's before they sink all your ships. All the
other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board. You try and hit them by calling out the
coordinates of one of the squares on the board. The other player also tries to hit your ships by calling
out coordinates. Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess
where they are. Each board in the physical game has two grids: the lower (horizontal) section for the
player's ships and the upper part (vertical during play) for recording the player's guesses.
Starting a New Game
Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their board. The ships can only be placed vertically or
horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed. Ships cannot hang off the board, nor can they be placed
one over another.
Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.
The 5 ships are: Aircraft carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4 spaces), Destroyer (3 spaces), Corvette
(2 spaces) and Frigate (1 space)
Playing the Game
Player's take turns guessing by calling out the coordinates. The opponent responds with "hit" or "miss"
as appropriate. Both players should mark their board with pegs: H for hit, * for miss. For example, if
you call out F6 and your opponent does not have any ship located at F6, your opponent will respond
with "miss". You record the miss F6 by placing a *on the lower part of your board at F6.
When all the squares that one of your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk. You should
announce "hit and sunk". In the physical game, a red peg is placed on the top edge of the vertical board
to indicate a sunk ship.
As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.

Your grid will look something like below:
